# todolist
This is repo for my todo-list app  (Tutorial App).


Thanks for being here. This is my first GitHub project. Hello everyone. I am Yashodhan Chafekar. I am B.Tech Engineering student and here is my first code along tutorial project. This was great learning experience. Special thanks to Dennis Ivy Youtube channel for posting this tutorial online. I don't claim this code entirely mine, but this is learning step for me. Happy to be here.

This project gives user ability to create a Todo-List. Simple CRUD operations on to do list. To do list have following fields. Title, Description, Created_date, Meetlink(for online meetig link.), complete(Task done or not done).

Here Title is CharField. Description is TextField. Created_Date is DateTimeField. Meetlink is clickable URLField. Complete is BooleanField.

App is Loginrequired. It lands user on Task list view. Generally todo list does not need to be seperated datewise( that is new list for new date). So here each task has created_date. After done you can delete task. You can edit and create task as well. I am happy if anyone can use this project as it is. Thanks for being here, and wish me luck for my future journey as developer.
